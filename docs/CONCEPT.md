# Project Concept

## Why (One Sentence)

The Hearthlink CORE Runtime is a sandboxed, offline inference engine that performs model execution only and has no authority over data, tools, or system actions.

## Vibe (Three Keywords)

1. **Minimal** - Pure function: tokens in, tokens out. No scope creep.
2. **Secure** - Sandboxed, isolated, zero network access, least privilege.
3. **Traceable** - Deterministic execution with observable metrics, no hidden state.

## Anti-Goals (What This Is NOT)

- NOT an agent (no autonomous decision-making)
- NOT a plugin host (no external code execution)
- NOT a connector layer (no network access)
- NOT a policy engine (no governance authority)
- NOT a memory store (no persistent state)
- NOT an orchestrator (no workflow management)

## Design Pillars Alignment

| Pillar | How CORE Supports It |
|--------|---------------------|
| Data Sovereignty | No persistent storage or network - cannot leak data |
| System Integrity | Sandbox + isolation - cannot bypass boundaries |
| AI Governance | No authority - cannot act independently |
| System Reliability | Stateless + restartable - safe recovery |
