# AUDIT REPORT

**Tribunal Date**: 2026-02-14T08:45:00+00:00
**Target**: Health Check Probes
**Risk Grade**: L2
**Auditor**: The QoreLogic Judge

## VERDICT: PASS

---

### Executive Summary

The Health Check Probes plan demonstrates clean separation of concerns with a dedicated health module composed into the IPC layer via message types. The intentional auth bypass for health endpoints follows the standard orchestrator pattern (Kubernetes/systemd probes require unauthenticated endpoints). All proposed files remain well under Section 4 limits. No violations detected.

### Audit Results

#### Security Pass

**Result**: PASS

The plan correctly specifies NO AUTH for health check endpoints. This is the correct pattern for orchestrator probes:
- Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes cannot authenticate
- systemd health checks need direct access
- The design documents this explicitly as "NO AUTH REQUIRED for health checks"

This is intentional security design, not a bypass.

#### Ghost UI Pass

**Result**: PASS (N/A)

Backend-only feature. No UI elements proposed.

#### Section 4 Razor Pass

**Result**: PASS

| File | Projected Lines | Limit | Status |
|------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| health.rs | ~60 | 250 | OK |
| lib.rs | ~132 | 250 | OK |
| protocol.rs | ~156 | 250 | OK |
| handler.rs | ~175 | 250 | OK |
| health_test.rs | ~120 | 250 | OK |

All functions estimated at 10-15 lines. No nested ternaries. Nesting depth ≤2.

#### Dependency Pass

**Result**: PASS

No new external dependencies. Uses only:
- `std::time::Instant` (builtin)
- `serde` (already present)
- `tokio::sync` (already present)

#### Orphan Pass

**Result**: PASS

| Proposed File | Build Path | Status |
|---------------|------------|--------|
| health.rs | lib.rs → pub mod health | Connected |
| protocol.rs | ipc/mod.rs → IpcMessage | Connected |
| handler.rs | ipc/mod.rs → IpcHandler | Connected |
| health_test.rs | tests/ → cargo test | Connected |

#### Macro-Level Architecture Pass

**Result**: PASS

- Clean module boundary: health as separate concern from inference
- Unidirectional dependency: ipc/handler → health (not reverse)
- Composition via IpcMessage variants (stateless, composable)
- Single source of truth: HealthChecker aggregates all health state
- No cyclic dependencies detected

### Violations Found
