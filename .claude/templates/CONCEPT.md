# Project Concept

## Why (One Sentence)

<!--
INSTRUCTION: Replace this with a single sentence explaining WHY this project/feature exists.
If you cannot explain it in one sentence, the scope is too large - break it down.
-->

[Your one-sentence "Why" here]

## Vibe (Three Keywords)

<!--
INSTRUCTION: Three keywords that capture the design philosophy.
Examples: "Minimal", "Secure", "Fast", "Elegant", "Robust", "Traceable"
-->

1. [Keyword 1]
2. [Keyword 2]
3. [Keyword 3]

## Anti-Goals (What This Is NOT)

<!--
INSTRUCTION: Explicitly state what this project will NOT do.
This prevents scope creep and sets clear boundaries.
-->

- [What this explicitly excludes]
- [What this explicitly excludes]
- [What this explicitly excludes]

## Success Criteria

INSTRUCTION: How will we know when this is "done"-
Be specific and measurable.
-->
