# Shadow Genome

## Purpose

The Shadow Genome documents **failure modes** - approaches that were rejected, patterns that failed, and lessons learned. This creates institutional memory to prevent repeated mistakes.

---

## Failure Categories

| Code | Category | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `COMPLEXITY_VIOLATION` | Section 4 Razor breach | Function/file too long, nesting too deep |
| `SECURITY_STUB` | Incomplete security | TODO/placeholder in auth/security code |
| `GHOST_PATH` | Disconnected UI | UI element without backend handler |
| `HALLUCINATION` | Invalid dependency | Library that doesn't exist or wasn't verified |
| `ORPHAN` | Dead code | File not connected to build path |
| `SPEC_DRIFT` | Blueprint mismatch | Implementation doesn't match specification |
| `CHAIN_BREAK` | Merkle violation | Hash chain integrity compromised |

---

## Failure Log

<!--
Each failure is documented with:
- Date and iteration
- What was attempted
- Why it failed
- Pattern to avoid
- Resolution (if any)
-->

## Pattern Library (Extracted Lessons)

<!--
Aggregate lessons from failures into reusable patterns.
-->

### Section 4 Razor Violations

| Anti-Pattern | Correct Pattern | Examples |
|--------------|-----------------|----------|
| 50+ line functions | Split at 40 lines | See Failure #X |
| 4+ nesting levels | Early returns | See Failure #Y |
| Nested ternaries | Named functions | See Failure #Z |

### Security Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Correct Pattern | Examples |
|--------------|-----------------|----------|
| `// TODO: auth` | Full implementation | See Failure #X |
| Hardcoded tokens | Environment vars | See Failure #Y |

### Architecture Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Correct Pattern | Examples |
|--------------|-----------------|----------|
| God objects | Single responsibility | See Failure #X |
| Orphan files | Import tracing | See Failure #Y |

## Usage Notes

1. **Add entries when**:
   - /ql-audit returns VETO
   - Implementation fails Section 4 checks
   - Dead code is discovered
   - Any rejected approach

2. **Review entries when**:
   - Starting similar work
   - Seeing repeated violations
   - Onboarding new team members

3. **Extract patterns when**:
   - Same failure type occurs 3+ times
   - A clear anti-pattern emerges
