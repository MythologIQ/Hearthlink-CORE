# Architecture Plan

## Risk Grade

<!--
INSTRUCTION: Select ONE risk grade based on the criteria below.
-->

**Selected Grade**: [ ] L1  [ ] L2  [ ] L3

### Risk Assessment Checklist

- [ ] Contains security/auth logic -> **L3**
- [ ] Modifies encryption or PII handling -> **L3**
- [ ] Modifies existing APIs or data schemas -> **L2**
- [ ] Adds new business logic -> **L2**
- [ ] UI-only changes, no logic -> **L1**
- [ ] Documentation or comments only -> **L1**

**Justification**: [Why this risk grade was selected]

---

## File Tree (The Contract)

<!--
INSTRUCTION: List EVERY file that will be created or modified.
This is the "Promise" that the Specialist must fulfill.
-->

```
project/
|-- src/
|   |-- [file1.ts]          # [purpose]
|   |-- [file2.ts]          # [purpose]
|   `-- [directory]/
|       `-- [file3.ts]      # [purpose]
|-- tests/
|   `-- [file1.test.ts]     # [what it tests]
`-- [other files as needed]
```

---

## Interface Contracts

<!--
INSTRUCTION: For each significant component, define its interface.
This is what the Specialist will implement.
-->

### [Component Name]

**Purpose**: [One sentence describing what this does]

**Input**:
```typescript
interface [ComponentName]Input {
  [field]: [type];  // [description]
}
```

**Output**:
```typescript
interface [ComponentName]Output {
  [field]: [type];  // [description]
}
```

**Side Effects**:
- [State changes, if any]
- [API calls, if any]
- [File I/O, if any]

**Error Handling**:
- [How errors are handled]

---

## Data Flow

<!--
INSTRUCTION: Show how data moves through the system.
-->

```
[Entry Point]
      |
      v
[Processing Step 1] --> [Output 1]
      |
      v
[Processing Step 2] --> [Output 2]
      |
      v
[Final Output]
```

---

## Dependencies

<!--
INSTRUCTION: List any external packages required.
Each must be justified - if vanilla JS can do it in <10 lines, don't add it.
-->

| Package | Version | Justification | Vanilla Alternative- |
|---------|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| [name] | [ver] | [why needed] | No - [reason] |

**Dependency Diet Check**:
- [ ] Each dependency is truly necessary
- [ ] No dependency can be replaced with <10 lines vanilla code
- [ ] No "God packages" (lodash, moment, etc.) unless absolutely required

---

## Section 4 Razor Pre-Check

<!--
INSTRUCTION: Verify your plan won't violate KISS constraints.
-->

- [ ] All planned functions can be <= 40 lines
- [ ] All planned files can be <= 250 lines
- [ ] No logic requires > 3 nesting levels
- [ ] No nested ternaries planned

**If any box is unchecked**: Revise the plan to split components.

---

## Test Strategy

<!--
INSTRUCTION: What tests will verify this implementation-
-->

| Test Type | Target | Success Criteria |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Unit | [component] | [what passes] |
| Integration | [flow] | [what passes] |

---

## Security Considerations

<!--
INSTRUCTION: Required for L2/L3. List security implications.
-->

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] No bypass mechanisms
- [ ] Input validation planned
- [ ] Error messages don't leak info

**If L3**: Formal security review required before implementation.
